## Overview

This program models a deterministic finite automaton (DFA).
Through the use of different classes and packages it imitates
the entirety of a DFA by including states, possible transtions
and allows the user to create its own DFA and test it.

## Reflection

@FIXIT
Write a brief (2-3 paragraph) reflection describing your experience with this 
project. Answer the following questions (but feel free to add other insights): 
- What worked well and what was a struggle?
- What concepts still aren't quite clear?
- What techniques did you use to make your code easy to debug and modify?
- What would you change about your design process?
- If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself about doing this project?

## Compiling and Using 
@FIXIT

This section should tell the user how to compile your code.  It is
also appropriate to instruct the user how to use your code. Does your
program require user input? If so, what does your user need to know
about it to use it as quickly as possible?
